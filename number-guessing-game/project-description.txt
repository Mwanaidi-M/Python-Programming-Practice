NUMBER GUESSING GAME

The number guessing game is built on the player's notion to estimate a number between the provided range.
If the player predicts the desired number, the player wins; otherwise, the player loses the game.
Since this game has limited efforts thus, the player needs to indicate the number with the limited attempts.
Otherwise, the player will lose the game.

This should be a simple interactive program in Python where the computer will take the role of the
first player while you play as the second player.

1. Decide on a set of global variables that contain the state of the game. For example, one obvious
choice is the secret number that has been generated by the program.
2. Figure out how to generate a random secret number in a given range, low to high. Suggestion to use the
range [0, 100] in your first implementation. Hint: look at the functions in the random module to figure
out how to easily select such a random number.
3. You must input only valid integers within the provided range.
4. You will be granted limited tries to estimate the number.
5. You cannot exit the game once begun.

If the input number is less than or more significant than the needed number, the player receives the
message (hint) to move further in up or down range.

First is to produce a random number between a defined range in such a game. Ask the player to estimate
this number. If the guess is accurate, report that the guess is correct and break out of the loop. Else
specify whether the number is less or more significant than the actual number.

Provide the player with 5 chances and if they fail to guess the right number by then, break out of the loop
and inform them of the right value.
